# Download Instructions

If you're experiencing issues downloading the project, here are some solutions:

## Option 1: Download without node_modules
The large `node_modules` folder (385MB) may be causing download issues. After downloading:

1. Extract the project
2. Run `npm install` to reinstall dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development

## Option 2: Manual Setup
If download continues to fail, you can recreate the project:

1. Create a new React + TypeScript project with Vite
2. Install the dependencies listed in `package.json`
3. Copy the source code from the project root directory
4. Copy configuration files: `tailwind.config.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`

## Option 3: Git Clone (Recommended)
Since this is a Git repository, you can:

1. Clone the repository using Git
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start with `npm run dev`

## Key Files to Copy
- `/src/` - All React components and pages
- `/server/` - Express.js backend
- `/shared/` - TypeScript schemas
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- Configuration files (tailwind, vite, tsconfig)

The project is now optimized for download with unnecessary assets removed.
